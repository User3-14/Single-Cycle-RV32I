# RV32I Single-Cycle Processor (VHDL)

This repository contains a single-cycle implementation of a RISC-V processor supporting the **RV32I base instruction set**, written in VHDL. It was developed as our Computer Architecture course's project at university.

The processor features a clean datapath design, custom control unit, and a built-in data memory controller to support a wide range of memory access instructions.

> üß† This project will serve as the base for a planned summer upgrade to a **5-stage pipelined RV64I** processor.

## üß† Data Memory Controller

To support byte and halfword load/store instructions (e.g., `lb`, `lh`, `lbu`, `sb`, `sh`), a custom **Data Memory Controller** was implemented within the memory module.

Key features:
- **Byte-addressable memory array** using 8-bit elements
- **Alignment masking** to ensure correctness for `sw/lw`, `sh/lh`, and `sb/lb`
- **Sign-extension & zero-extension** handling for `lb` and `lbu`
- **Offset-based access control** to simplify operation decoding
- Seamless integration into the single-cycle datapath

This design enhances instruction support while minimizing datapath complexity‚Äîallowing future upgrades to a pipelined architecture with fewer changes.

## üî≠ Future Work

This project is planned to evolve into a:
- **5-stage pipelined RV64I processor**
- Full instruction and hazard support
- Branch prediction unit
- Memory-mapped IO integration
- Synthesis on FPGA hardware
